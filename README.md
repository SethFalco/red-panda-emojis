## Technical Details

### OpenRaster (ORA)

All project files in this repository are `.ora` files, the file format for [OpenRaster](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRaster).

OpenRaster is an interchange format developed by the Open Source community, including the developers of [Krita](https://krita.org) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org).

#### Why are we using ORA?

* It's a patent free and open format with a [public specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/OpenRaster/).
* It's designed to be an interchange format, unlike PSD, or XCF which are internal structures.
* Widely backed by the Open Source community, and is even the default format for MyPaint and Nathive.
* Supports layers and other project features that formats like PNG don't.
* Can be opened without specialized software, try opening it as a ZIP
file and look inside!

#### What if my drawing software doesn't support OpenRaster?

You'll probably be able to convert the OpenRaster file into another format compatible with your drawing software. [Krita](https://krita.org) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) are both free programs that are capable of reading ORA files and exporting them into formats like PSD. When converting it back, be wary of vendor-specific features that may have been used when drawing the image, you may have to rasterize or merge some layers.

Meanwhile, you could always ask them to support the format!
