## Adding Emojis

There are three acceptable ways to include new emojis in the repository, in order of preference:

1. Fork the repository on GitLab, and use `git` to push your emoji and open a merge request.
1. If you don't know how to open a merge request, you can open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/SethFalco/red-panda-emojis/issues) with your emoji attached.
1. If you don't have a GitLab account and are reluctant to make one, email [Seth Falco](mailto:seth@falco.fun) and attach your emoji.

If you follow either option 2 or 3, you must do the following in your message:

* Attach a copy of the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and declare that you understand the license terms.
* Share the name and email address you'd like to use for attribution.
